Fixing messy data: 
What I did=
organize by species
seperate males and females
organize be increasing plot number
within increasing plot number I organized with increasing date
if any plot number and dates were the same I then put them in order by increasing weight 

Things wrong with original setup=
must assume that these are the same species 
uliminate incomplete data 
consistantly organize the data
